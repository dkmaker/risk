# App Icons for Risk Dice PWA

Please create the following PNG icons for the app:

## Required Sizes:
- `icon-180.png` - 180x180px (for iOS home screen)
- `icon-192.png` - 192x192px (for Android/PWA manifest)
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512px (for PWA splash screens)

## Design Guidelines:
- Use PNG format with transparency
- Square dimensions (1:1 ratio)
- Include some dice imagery or "ðŸŽ²" symbol
- Use colors from the app: #1a1a2e (dark blue background), #f39c12 (orange), #cc0000 (red), #0066cc (blue)
- Make sure the icon is visible on both light and dark backgrounds
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Maskable Icon:
The icons should work as "maskable" icons, meaning they should have enough padding (safe zone) so they look good when cropped into circles or other shapes by different operating systems.
